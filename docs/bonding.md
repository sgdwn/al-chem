## Ionic Bonding  
- Involves an electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions in a lattice

## Covalent + Dative Covalent Bonds  
- Single covalent bond - 1 pair of shared electrons  
- Double covalent bond - 2 pairs of shared electrons  
- Dative covalent (coordinate) bond - both electrons in a pair come from 1 atom  
o Represented with arrow - points away from the donor  
## Metallic Bonding  
- Attraction between positive ions and delocalised electrons in an ionic lattice  
- Simple cubic lattice  
  o All atoms are on the vertices of the cube  
- Body-centred cubic  
  o Atoms on vertex of cube + 1 in centre  
- Face-centred cubic  
  o Atoms on vertex of cube + 4 atoms in between

## Bonding + Physical Properties  
### Ionic  
- Electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, in a lattice  
### Metallic  
- Bonding that holds metals together  
- Delocalised electrons allow for electrical conductivity, and arenâ€™t attached to any single nucleus  
### Giant Covalent  
- Large molecules, linked by covalent bonds  
### Molecular  
- A molecule - may be held to other molecules with van der Waals forces, permanent dipole-dipole forces, or H-bonding  

Forces between Molecules - Intermolecular Forces
| van der Waals | Come about due to random movement of electrons - causes a slightly positive end and a slightly negative end  Stronger in molecules with higherMr  Present in all  substances | 1 |  
| Induced dipole-dipole | Where a molecule is polarised by those around it, giving it dipoles while near other atoms | 2 |  
| Permanent dipole-dipole | Where the electrons are pulled slightly closer to 1 atom, causing a slightly negative end (-) and a slightly positive end (+) | 3 |  
| Hydrogen bonding | Stronger version of permanent dipole-dipole  Only present when Hydrogen is bonded to Fluorine, Oxygen, or Nitrogen  No. of H-bonds = no. of lone electron pairs or no. of hydrogens (whichever is lower) | 4 |
