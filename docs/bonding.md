## Ionic Bonding  
- Involves an electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions in a lattice  
- Sulfate - $SO_4 ^{2+}$  
- Hydroxide - $OH^-$  
- Nitrate - $NO_3 ^-$  
- Carbonate - $CO_3 ^{2-}$  
- Ammonium - $NH_4 ^-$  
## Covalent + Dative Covalent Bonds  
- Single covalent bond - 1 pair of shared electrons  
- Double covalent bond - 2 pairs of shared electrons  
- Dative covalent (coordinate) bond - both electrons in a pair come from 1 atom  
o Represented with arrow - points away from the donor  
## Metallic Bonding  
- Attraction between positive ions and delocalised electrons in an ionic lattice  
- Simple cubic lattice  
o All atoms are on the vertices of the cube  
- Body-centred cubic  
o Atoms on vertex of cube + 1 in centre  
- Face-centred cubic  
o Atoms on vertex of cube + 4 atoms in between
